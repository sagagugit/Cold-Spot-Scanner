# How to run cold spot scanner 

This allows you to easy identify the cold spots in protein protein interfaces using structural features.

Please input the "PDB ID" of the Protein complex and chain IDs to define the interface of the protein complex under the sub category "PDB ID and chains".

This will identify cold spots using three scenarios.

(I) Cold Spots at positions that do not interact with the binding partner.

(II) Cold spots at positions that exhibit unfavourable Charge-Hydrophobic
interactions.

(III) Cold spots at positions that exibit unfavorable Same charge
interactions .
